This is a dummy project with some dummy code and tests. Feel free to change anything you want. However, your goal is to build a cool CI/CD pipeline with as many cool tools as you can find. Over-engineering is our goal here. We will reuse the project (and thus your pipelines) later, so it won't get lost.

There is already a small predefined pipeline. Have a look at `.gitlab-ci.yml`.


You can use the dummy project as follows
```shell
poetry install
poetry run python3 noiseTool/main.py printnumbers
```
